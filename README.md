      o Context Awareness: The integrated terminal starts at the root of your workspace, making it context-aware.

      o Links and Error Detection: VS Code integrates with the editor, thus supporting features like clickable links and error highlighting.

      o Shell Integration: With Shell Integration VS Code tracks where commands are run, providing additional information and decorations.

   d) External Terminal:
      Should the user want to use an external terminal, they can open it using Ctrl+Shift+C for users of Windows OS.

9. Debugging in VS Code:
   - Outline the steps to set up and start debugging a simple program in VS Code. What are some key debugging features available in VS Code?

   The following steps must be followed in debugging a simple program in VS Code.

   Step 1.

   The User must create a Sample Application e.g. 

      o First, create a simple application (e.g., a Node.js app) in your workspace. You can follow the Node.js walkthrough to set up a basic “Hello World” JavaScript application (e.g., app.js)

   Step 2.

   Open the Run and Debug View:

      o User to Open the Run and Debug icon in the Activity Bar on side of VS Code.

      o Alternatively, User can use the keyboard shortcut Ctrl+Shift+D on Windows 11 OS.

   Step 3.
   
   Configure Launch Settings:

      o If the file, "launch.json", which stores the debugging configuration doesn't exist, VS Code will show the Run start view.

      o To create a "launch.json" file, select “create a launch.json file” in the Run start view.

      o VS Code will try to detect your debug environment automatically, but you can choose it manually if needed.

      example :

      {
  "version": "0.2.0",
  "configurations": [
    {
      "type": "node",
      "request": "launch",
      "name": "Launch Program",
      "skipFiles": ["<node_internals/**>"],
      "program": "${workspaceFolder}/app.js"
    }
  ]
}

   Step 4.

   Run and Debug

      o User can Press F5 or click the Run button to start debugging.

      o VS Code will run your currently active file (or the one specified in launch.json).

   Step 5. 

   Breakpoints and Inspecting Variables: 

      o Set breakpoints by clicking the gutter next to a line of code.

      o While debugging, inspect variables, view call stacks, and evaluate expressions.

      o Use the Watch panel to monitor specific variables.

   Step 6. 

   Other Debugging Features:

      o Conditional Breakpoints: Set breakpoints based on conditions.
      
      o Logpoints: Add log messages without stopping execution.

      o Step Over, Step Into, and Step Out: Navigate through code during debugging.

      o Exception Handling: Configure how exceptions are handled.
NB : VS Code’s built-in debugger accelerates your edit-compile-debug loop, making it easier to find and fix issues!
